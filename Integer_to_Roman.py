'''
12. Integer to Roman

PROBLEM:

Example 1:
Input: num = 3749
Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"
Explanation:
3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places

Example 2:
Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation:
50 = L
 8 = VIII
 
Example 3:
Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation:
1000 = M
 900 = CM
  90 = XC
   4 = IV
 

Constraints:
1 <= num <= 3999
